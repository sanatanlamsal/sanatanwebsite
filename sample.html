<h1><p>Joseph Charles Buttler MBE (born 8 September 1990) is an English cricketer who captains the England cricket team in limited overs cricket and plays for the England Test team. He is considered one of the best white-ball batsmen in the world.[1] In domestic cricket he represents Lancashire, having previously played for Somerset, and has played in multiple Twenty20 leagues, including for Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.

Buttler made his T20I debut in 2011, his ODI debut 2012, and his Test debut in 2014. He was part of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, and made the run out during the Super Over which sealed victory in the final.[2] He was appointed captain of England's limited overs teams in June 2022.[3]

Buttler plays as a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman. He is England's second-most-capped T20I player behind Eoin Morgan.[4] Along with Adil Rashid, he holds the world record for highest seventh-wicket stand in ODIs: 177 against New Zealand during their 2015 tour of England.[5] He is England's second-highest run-scorer in T20Is behind Morgan,[6] and is one of only four Englishmen to score a T20I century.[7] As a wicket-keeper, he holds the England ODI record for most dismissals (221),[8] as well as the England T20I record for most dismissals (53).[9]
